# LaTeX for LING566

This project contains 5 files:

1. `avm.sty` -- a required style file to get AVMs to compile
2. `tutorial.tex` -- a commented file that explains the basics of the LaTeX you will need to know for completing the homeworks
3. `hw_template.tex` -- a barebones template that you can use each week to quickly get started on the next homework
4. `structure_skeletons.tex` -- a file that contains the LaTeX code you need to get started on a tree or AVM. You don't have to use this, I just usually am lazy and like pasting the basic structure before starting my trees/AVMs
5. `structure_examples.tex` -- a file that contains fully filled out examples of trees and AVMs from the book. This is meant to serve as a reference for when the homeworks start requiring new LaTeX tricks that maybe didn't get covered in the tutorial.
